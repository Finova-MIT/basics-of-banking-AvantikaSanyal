Finance has three main relevant categories - Public Finance, Corporate Finance and Personal Finance.
1. Asset - something of value
2. Balance sheet - record of liabilities and assets
3. Ewuity - ownership
4. Liability - financial obligation
5. Liquidity - how easily we can convert an asset to cash

This week, I learned a lot about finance and how important it is in everyday life. Before this, I thought finance was mostly about big businesses and banks, but now I realize it affects everyone, including me.

One of the most interesting things I learned was the time value of money. It means that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future because it can grow if invested. This made me think about
how saving and investing early can make a big difference in the long run.

I also found it fascinating how money has changed over time. The video on the history of money showed how we moved from barter systems to coins, paper money, and now digital payments. 
It made me wonder if cash will even exist in the future.

Another thing that stood out to me was how finance helps in decision-making. The videos explained how companies and people use finance to manage money wisely. It also made me think about my own spending and 
savings habits—maybe I should start planning better instead of just spending whatever I have.

Overall, I now understand why finance is such an important skill. It’s not just for experts; everyone needs to know how money works. I’m looking forward to learning more in the coming weeks and applying these 
lessons in real life.
